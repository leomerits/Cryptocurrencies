# Cryptocurrencies

# Overview of the Analysis
The overview of this analysis is a deeper dive into machine learning using unsupervised algorithms, which helped us explore data when we'r not sure what we're looking for,

# Summary:
In this module, we were able to:
- Describe the differences between supervised and unsupervised learning, including real-world examples of each.
- Preprocess data for unsupervised learning.
- Cluster data using the K-means algorithm.
- Determine the best number of centroids for K-means using the elbow curve.
- And use PCA to limit features and speed up the model.
